                            <h5>what is React?</h5>
                            <p>React is a javascript library/framework created and maintained by facebook that is used
                                for building user interfaces.So its technicallya UI library.</p>
                            <p>The diff bw react and angular is that react at its core is only responsible for creating
                                user interfaces, it doesn't have things like router or an http client built in, but we
                                have popular packages corresponding to it.</p>
                            <p>React gives us a way to build websites & UIs with organized and reusable Components.</p>
                            <p>The components can include the output,which is basically the html in react to use sth
                                called jsx, the logic or the javascript, and can also include the css within your
                                components.so the htmlI(jsx),css,js all are integrated ok.</p>
                            <p>so with react and other frontend frameworks we look at our UI as different components
                                like the searchbar,header,footer,blogpost so eth we look at as a component.</p>
                            <p>pic 1,2</p>
                            <strong>why learn react?</strong>
                            <p>organization - it made much easier to organize our UIs and our frontends.</p>
                            <p>Reusable components.And it is also more flexible to be used in different ways.</p>
                            <p>React is very declarative, means we write the code that we want and react is incharge of
                                taking our declared code and performing all the javascript and dom steps to us the
                                result that we want.</p>
                            <p>pic- declare code</p>
                            <p>if you see each one of these tags here is a component.we have app itself and then we have
                                header,employeesearch,employeelist,footer component.and this is how we embed components
                                .And components can also have props passed in which is basically attributes or arguments
                                that can be passed to that component.here we see a title prop passed into a header
                                component,it could be ath a string,any datatype also a function.employeelist takes a
                                prop ie employees which is a employees variable , which would most likely be an arry of
                                employee objects, and then in employee list component we can iterate through that obj
                                and output each one in its own component. </p>
                            <p>state is basically just data,you can have component level state ,app level state (data
                                used by multiple components)</p>
                            <p>event-wkt the buttons and ip fields fire off some kind of event to make sth happen.</p>
                            <h5>Environment setup</h5>
                            <p>install nodejs reason is we need npm which inturn used to create react app.Also we
                                install some 3rd party packages with npm.here text editor used is vscode- settings
                                semicolon false,single quotes (es7 reat/redux..snippets, bracket pair clorizer,github
                                theme,js es6 code snippets,prettier to format code, etc.install git,gitbash for windows
                                best ok.install react
                                developer tools.postman an http client.</p>
                            <strong>For all the projects code is in github repo ok </strong>
                            <p>later attach that document links v-5</p>

                        <div class="accordion-body">
                            <p>reactjs.org for docs- under installation we see the command to create the react app.</p>
                            <p>make sure node js installed.so open terminal cmd run - npx create-react-app appname
                                --use-npm / now it creates new folder appname it adds all the files and folders and
                                dependencies that we need to create a react application.</p>
                            <p>then change your directory to your project folder ok . npm start to start the development
                                server,npm run build which bundles all the js and creates the static assets for
                                production when you are ready to deploy.</p>
                            <p>we open the react folder from the vs code and .now we run the dev server from the
                                integrated terminal in vs code.you know.npm start will start our server in our localhost
                                3000.</p>
                            <p>package.json - here we have all of our dependencies.</p>
                            <p>(as we are creating a single page application) in public folder we have index.html, this
                                is the single page that is being loaded in the browser.it has some basic meta tages and
                                in body all it has is a div with with the id as root. </p>
                            <p>The reason for that is , when we build a single page application eth we do including all
                                our components ,any routes that we have, eth is done within javascript.its done within
                                react and then it is basically inserted into this div.so we can think this div as a
                                placeholder for our entire front end, our entire ui. </p>
                            <p>lets see how react knows to put it here in this div the whole thing.</p>
                            <p>also we can put the cdns eg fontawesome in head and use it.</p>
                            <p>nxt is a favicon so any static assets you want to put in here like images,you can do it
                                ok.</p>
                            <p>Source folder is where all the magic happens.thats where we create all of our
                                components,all of our context, ath that we do is really going to go in this source
                                folder.</p>
                            <p>lets delete all files then if we run we get error that index.js folder is not found in
                                source folder .. ok som</p>
                            <p>lets recreate the files and later see how the react had initialized ok..</p>
                            <p>first create index.js bcz thats what its been looked for, (shift f5 for hard refresh the
                                browser ok)Now if we run server we see the index page of publics ok.as we said that we
                                insert our react app or front end application into that div of id root.So that happens
                                in the index.js so this basically the entry point to react.</p>
                            <p>include imports ok react, react-dom (this lib allows us to interact with the document
                                object model in the browser.ReactDom has a method onit called render and it takes in two
                                things first is what ever we want to insert,which is going to be our main app component
                                , and the second argument is going to be where we want to put this and we want to put it
                                in the div with id of root ok so doc.getElid('root') ok then if we reload we see what
                                ever is put as a first argument, if is a h1 tag it will be displayed in browser or if an
                                app the all it will be displayed ok likewise.
                            </p>
                            <p>as a first argument we want our main app component displayed here not just h1 etc ok.So
                                react is made up of componetns and you have root component called app.and any other
                                components that we create ,whatever it might be , that's going to be embedded into that
                                main app component.</p>
                            <p>(in source folder)now lets create App.js which is our main app component .As far as
                                components, they can be either classes(old way of creating react comp) or
                                functions(modern way).with more modern react, we see functional components using sth
                                called hooks.</p>
                            <p>the function returns the jsx(ie javascript xml) its a syntactic sugar to basically put
                                our html directly into our js.</p>
                            <p>the function is returning jsx but it looks like an html ok.And we do have to export it
                                ok.And we go to index.js(sourec) we import and put it as first arg like an xml like
                                syntax ok.run it and see ok.</p>
                            <p>so index.html is loaded in browser and it looks for index.js(source folder where we bring
                                the react and react dom) here is where we call reactdom dender passing in our main app
                                comp, and thats being output into that div of id root.check in dev tools of crome ok .in
                                id root div we find all the code rendered ok. </p>
                            <p>there is sth called strict mode that react offers this adds additional checks and
                                warnings within our application.so we just rap of app comp in that respective tag ok
                                thats it.(react.strictmode) no difference in output but adds aditional check thats it.
                            </p>
                            <p>now lastly lets create global css file(index.css)and import this in index.js(source ok)
                                import ./index.css thats it.</p>
                            <h5>intro to jsx</h5>
                            <p>jsx is what is retured by all of our react components.its basically an html ,however its
                                syntactic sugar, its really js under the hood.</p>
                            <p>it just allows us to write html within our components,which makes it much more convinient
                                .rules - rap in parenthesis() ,But note what we return has to be just one main or parent
                                element ok you know.so h1,p,h2 etch is not possible only one is possible ok.so put it in
                                a div ok simple.so all three now is rapped in one parent element .so remember always one
                                parent element. OR fragment empty angle bracketss &lt>...&lt/>.</p>
                            <p>Note there are some differences bw html and jsx,ie theres some attributes that you can't
                                use. eg: class='contaitner' an invalid dom property so in jsx we use
                                className='container' ,also we don't use for attribute in jsx,in jsx htmlFor instead of
                                for ok</p>
                            <p>Note we can also create the tags in regular js like {return
                                React.createElement('div',{className:'container'},React .createElement('h1',{},'My
                                contents'))}.But note somu using as regualr html is ok ok ie by jsx much easier.</p>
                            <h5>Dynamic values & Lists in jsx</h5>
                            <p>Note above the return ie before return(of jsx) we can create variables and functions and
                                so on.But these variable created like this will be actually the part or your state And
                                this is not how you set state in react. in functional components there is a hook called
                                usestate ok </p>
                            <p>to output sth dynamic like a variable or an expression,we just use curly
                                braces.&lth1>{title}&lt/h1></p>
                            <p>in ul { comments.map((com,index)=>(
                                &ltli>{com.text}&lt/li>)) } - observe ok comments is an array and we output jsx(html)
                                via arrow function and map ok thats it.</p>
                            <p>note each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop ok.so make sure when you create
                                a list using map you have to add key onto to lis ok &ltli key={index(any unique value
                                ok)}>{com.text}&lt/li></p>
                            <p>this is how we output variables,expressions,create lists</p>
                            <h5>conditionals in jsx</h5>

                            <p>After creating the Header.jsx(component) in it we create a functional component es7
                                react/redux install so without typing you can do like this ok .. rfce/_rfce for
                                functional
                                component ok thats it it createa comp for us.</p>
                            <p>we no longer need to import React ok for all componets </p>
                            <p>what ever components we create we need to bring it in App.js ok(so we just import that
                                header comp and use it as a tag &ltHeader/> in main comp app.js thats it)</p>

                            <p>props can be passed into a component.they are essentially the properties of that

    &ltHeader text='Subramanyam'/>  app.js

    //we do it via a parameter, Header(props) that props is going to be an object with and props that are passed in,

    Header(props)
    &lth2>{props.text}&lt/h2> in header comp

                                style={{backgroundColor:'red',color:'blue'}} observe property
                                it is css in jsx</p>
                            <p>or you can put your styles in a varable like</p>
                            <pre>
<code>
const headerstyles = {
    backgroundColor:'red',

                            <p>state is basically just data.we have component level state(data that is associated with
                                that one specific component eg: you set a state in a comp (navigation comp having open
                                and closed state and no other use or access it ok), then no other comp can use this
                                data) and app level or global state(here the state is used in multiple components , to
                                share a state among multiple components).</p>
                            <p>we set state in react using a hook called useState.note hooks always start with u's</p>
                            <p>so import useState hook.to set a piece of state we go above return and do as below</p>
                            <pre>
    <code>
       const [rating,setRating] = useSteate(7)  -so useState is a function , then we destructure it via array to get the values retured by this function
                            -it takes in what ever the default you want for this piece of state eg default of 7 here
                            -we put 2 things in arr one is name of this piece of state(rating here),second is the function to update this piece of state(setRating)
                            -and we use it like {rating} ok.
            - to change a piece of state we call the respective method ok
        //suppose on button click..  onClick={handleClick} on firing of this event we call that function observe- you know functions written above return 

        const handleClick=(){
            setRating(10)
            //we simply can't change like this rating = 10 we can only reset as above ok som..

            //another way by passing a fun so as to know the prev state and return our new state based on it

            setRating((prev)=>{
                console.log(prev)

&ltFeedbackList feedback=feedback1

//and in feedbacklist we destructure it and use as prop ok its basically a kind of prop 
//observe the project code properly abt map,feedbackitem,feedbacklist how we have used

                            <p>now lets create a card component where we can pass in ath we want and have ,the
                                respective styles like bgd,rounded corners, ie card design etc.So for proper ordering
                                purpose lets create a shared(as we're going to use this card comp in multiple places)
                                folder in components folder .And inside shared lets create Card.jsx(ie card comp) .later
                                import it where ever you want to use it.now insted of div tag we use the Card tag and
                                pass the respective things as need ok.so we use props( any elemet or tags etc) and
                                destructure(children just a name here or check it later eg ok) ok</p>
                            <p>.car.reverse{} means any class of card that also has reverse.</p>
                            <pre>
    <code>
conditional class:

destructuring ok function Card({childer,reverse})
{
    return (&ltdiv className='card reverse'>{children}&lt/div>)
}
export 

~ card is always there but reverse class is conditional

return &ltdiv className={`card ${reverse && 'reverse'}`}>{children}&lt/div>

conditional style;

return &ltdiv className='card' style={{backgroundColor:reverse?'rgb(0,0,0,0.4)' : '#fff' , color:reverse? '#fff' : '#000',}}>{children}&lt/div>

    </code>
</pre>
                            <p>You also can do like this, you dont pass revese as a prop then you have to use default
                                props ok and if needed or you want to use proptypes you can.</p>
                            <p>its your wish to use default props and also the proptypes </p>

                            <p>we can use fontawesome for this we can include the cdn in the public/index.html but there
                                is other cool pkg called react icons. so in vs terminal stop the server and install it

                                npm i react-icons now start server and use it by importing the respective icons ok </p>
                            <p>events: can use named functions onClick={handleClick} or can write a function there
                                itself ok onClick={()=cl{iteml.id }}</p>

                                there should be change in items in app.js so we need to go upwards. we do this by prop
                                lets see it.
                            </p>

</pre>
                            <p>here we're passing in props so this is prop drilling.this approach is kind of a messy
                                ,but later on we're going to use the context API.where instead of prop drill we can
                                bring our state(data) directly into any component we want.</p>

                            <p>in components create a feedbackstats.jsx(a comp), and bring it to app.js. And to this
                                comp from app.js we pass in feedback as a prop.since feedback is our state(**) ,so
                                whenever that state(data) changes(by any other comp also ),it will automatically change
                                within feedbackstats comp also.</p>
                            <p>so thats why you want your state to be a single source of truth,so that whenever that
                                changes,, ath that is connected to it ,it will also change.</p>
                            <p>for reduce function it takes in two parameter one is accumultor default set to 0 here

                            <h5>Creating Routes(React Router5)</h5>
                            <p>check in dependencies that react route dom has been updated to v6 ok, lets change to work
                                with v5 , </p>
                            <p>React itself doesn't havea router buitin, But there is a package called React Router Dom,
                                npm install react-router-dom, here we need home page route,about page route,lets put it
                                in pages folder, create aboutpage.jsx, </p>
                            <p>(here that aboutpage) ath we want to put in a specific route ,we're going to bring into
                                app.js , so import that aboutpage, import routers ,browserouter som/about good
                                ok,hashrouter som/#about</p>
                            <p>route,which is a specific comp for rendering whatever you want to render,whether its a
                                comp or just some output in a specific route,</p>
                            <p>inorder to use the router,we actually have to wrap eth in our app.js inside of
                                router,(which is here we're using browserrouter) ,to create a route we simply use the
                                route comp,</p>
                            <p>as we're embedding about in app.js, similarly remaining comps are also embeded in app.js
                                ok,so they are just displayed as listed, so ie all mixed,</p>
                            <p>so only we put them wantever we want as a sep page or route, in their respective routes,
                                ie in simple we vary the paths for them ok som...</p>
                            <p>instead of opening and clossing tag and putting sth in them , we put the self clossing
                                tag and then pass in a component prop to it which takes in Aboutpage(which is imported)
                                so now on /about this page gets loaded.</p>
                            <p>for index or home page we just give path="/" </p>
                            <p>exact prop to match the path exactly...you know why we used it /,/about both are loaded
                                when searched /about , so to avoid it exact is used.</p>

                            <p>simply if we put a plain old a tag in about page for eg, ie &lta href='/'>back to
                                home&lt/a> it works ok but avoid using a tag.</p>



                            <h5>Upgrading To Reach Route6</h5>
                            <p>here in addition to route we also need to bring in routes and surround all the route
                                created in Routes tag okk..,also instead of component={Aboutpage} we use
                                element={&ltAboutpage/>} so its going to be jsx,sllr for multiple comps we use fragments
                                ok observe okk.</p>


                            <h5>Creating Links(v5 & v6)</h5>
                            <p>as we know how to create routes,now lets see how to create links to those routes/pages
                                okkk.</p>
                            <p>created a question mark icon comp, import in app.js, embed it in app.js, Now in about
                                link comp if we create it via a link tag it works but the flaw is you observe it
                                actually refreshes the page which we don't want okk.,so to all be done
                                immediately/instantly
                                without a refresh we do it by Link which we bring from reactrouter dom.</p>
                            <p>a tag is ok if you go to any external websites,but for any internal links don't use a tag
                            </p>
                            <p>so in aboutlink comp import Link, instead of a tag use link and to instead of href,thats
                                it</p>
                            <pre>
<code>
&ltLink to='/'>Home&lt/link>

insted of string here we can have obj ok, so with double curly braces

&ltLink to={{
    pathname:'/about',       - also can add opl parameters like
    search:'?sort=name',
    hash:'#hello',           -so likewise there are diff properties you can pass in okk
}}>Home&lt/link>
</code>
</pre>


                            <h5>NavLink & useParams</h5>
                            <p>navlink also used to navigate ,but it can also hold a specific class for active links, so
                                bring in navlink,</p>
                            <pre>
<code>
&ltNavLink to='/' activeClassName='active'>Home&lt/NavLink>

&ltNavLink to='/about' activeClassName='active'>About&lt/NavLink>

- so simply ntg but just that active style you styled will be applied to (text of the link Home or About here ok) which ever page you are in.

-lets see how to get params

&ltRoue path='/post/:id' elemet={&ltPost/>}/>     - app.js
&ltRoue path='/post/:id/:name' elemet={&ltPost/>}/> 

import useParams a hook...                         -post.js(comp ok)
create a state const params = useParams()
 &lth1>post {params.id&lt/h1>}
 &lth1>post {params.name&lt/h1>}       /home/39/somu

</code>
</pre>



                            <h5>Navigate & Nested Routes</h5>
                            <p>Redirect was present in vs , and now its changed to Navigate in v6 </p>
                            <pre>
<code>
import Navigate

const status = 200
if(status===404)
{
    &ltNavigate to='/notfound'/>    --create notfound(comp okk)
}


thats one way now on button click or sth if we want to navigate to some 
other route we can do like this

import useNavigate

const navigate = useNavigate()
const onClick=()=>{
    cl('sth to cl or update sth on server or etch and then goto new page this is how its done')
    navigate('/about')
}

&ltbutton onClick={onClick}>Click&lt/button>


-can also have nested routes 
ie if you have sth that you only want to show on a specific route,you can do as below..and to work below we need to have * as shown below in app.js okk


in post.js
import routes,route 

h1 post sth
button on click
sth                   -so after this 3 the below show will be rendered when we hit /show ie above 3 first then show contents ie the order you placed will be reflected...
&ltRoutes>
    &ltRoute path='/show' element=&lth1>helloworkd&lt/h1>
&lt/Routes>


app.js
&ltRoute path='/post/*' element={&ltpost/>}/>

gist is when show route is displayed post route is also there okk so now contents of both post and show is there, when we hit som/post/show
