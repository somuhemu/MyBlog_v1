                                <h4>Why programming?</h4>
                                <p>Everyone uses computers, mobile phones and many other gadgets in day to day life to
                                    access various
                                    applications.
                                    Different business domains like Education, Banking, E-Commerce, Healthcare,
                                    Insurance etc. use
                                    computer
                                    applications. These applications are built using programming. The knowledge of
                                    programming is
                                    essential to bring
                                    innovation. You need to know how to code to create value with your ideas.</p>


                                <h4>What is Programming?</h4>
                                <p>A set of such instructions is known as a program and the act of creating a program is
                                    known as
                                    programming.
                                    Programs are created to solve the problems, to automate the processes and to reduce
                                    repetitive
                                    and/or manual
                                    work.</p>
                                <p>To write these programs, you need a programming language. There are many programming
                                    languages; each
                                    one provides
                                    various features. Based on the requirements of your programs and features of the
                                    languages, you can
                                    choose
                                    appropriate language for writing your programs.
                                    In this course, you will learn programming using Java language which is one of the
                                    popular
                                    programming
                                    languages.</p>
                                <h5>Solution to a problem</h5>
                                <p>The solution to any problem involves the below three aspects.</p>
                                <img src="img/j1.png" alt="" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid d-block img-size">
                                <p>Process is basically a sequence of computations to be performed using some logic. You
                                    can observe in
                                    the diagram that a process may require inputs and provides output.</p>
                                <p>These complete set of steps is called as an Algorithm. Different logic gives rise to
                                    different
                                    algorithms.</p>
                                <img src="img/j2.png" alt="" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid d-block img-size">


                                <h4>Representation of Algorithms</h4>
                                <p>The first step to write a program is to create an algorithm. An algorithm is a
                                    process or set of
                                    rules to be followed by the computer while solving a problem. Algorithm should be
                                    represented into a
                                    form which others can easily understand. There are primarily two ways of
                                    representing an algorithm:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Pseudo-code: represents the algorithm in a way that is in between a programming
                                        language and
                                        English statements</li>
                                    <li>Flowchart: represents the algorithm in a diagrammatic way</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h5>Pseudo-code</h5>
                                <p>A pseudo-code looks as shown below.</p>
                                <img src="img/j3.png" alt="" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid d-block img-size">
                                <h5>Arithmetic and Relational Operators Logical Operators</h5>
                                <p>Arithmetic operators: Used for performing arithmetic operations</p>
                                <img src="img/j4.png" alt="" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid d-block img-size">
                                <p>Relational operators: Also known as comparison operators, are used to compare values.
                                    Result of a
                                    relational operation is always either true or false.
                                </p>
                                <img src="img/j5.png" alt="" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid d-block img-size">
                                <p>Logical operators: are used to combine one or more relational operations.</p>
                                <img src="img/j6.png" alt="" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid d-block img-size">
                                <h5>Flow Chart symbols</h5>
                                <p>The most commonly used symbols in a flowchart are as follows:</p>
                                <img src="img/j7.png" alt="" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid d-block img-size">
                                <p>The flowchart for the same requirements of calculating total cost is as shown below:
                                </p>

                                <h4>Introduction to Control Structures</h4>
                                <p>In the pseudo-code given before, all the statements execute sequentially but this is
                                    not necessary in
                                    every case. There could be cases where some of the statements in a pseudo-code need
                                    not be executed,
                                    or the cases where a set of statements have to be executed repeatedly. This is
                                    achieved through
                                    control structures.
                                    The statements which change the flow or order of execution of the instructions are
                                    called control
                                    structures.</p>
                                <p>There are three types of control structures:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Sequential</li>
                                    <li>Selection</li>
                                    <li>Iteration</li>
                                </ul>
                                <img src="img/j9.png" alt="" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid d-block img-size">


                                <h4>Selection/Decision Control Structure</h4>
                                <p>Selection control structures are implemented using if-else blocks. The if-else block
                                    in pseudo-code
                                    is written as:</p>


                                <h4>Iteration Control Structures</h4>
                                <p>a set of statements need to be repeatedly executed. When you want to repeatedly
                                    execute a set of
                                    statements as long as a condition is met, you can use iteration control structures
                                    which are also
                                    known as Loops. One such iteration control structure is while loop.</p>
                                <p>While loop is suitable when the number of iterations is not known in the beginning
                                    and the loop has
                                    to be executed as long as the given condition is satisfied. Sometimes, a set of
                                    statements have to
                                    be executed for a specific known number of times. In such cases, you can use for
                                    loop. </p>

                                    <li>The message is displayed using System.out.println which is used for displaying

                                    <li>Every statement in Java program must end with semicolon (;).</li>
                                    <li>Every statement in Java must be present inside a method. A method is a block of
                                        code that
                                        performs a particular task.</li>
                                    <li>In the code given above, the method is named as main. Every program in Java must
                                        have a main
                                        method as the code execution starts from the main method. </li>

                                    <li>Every method in Java must be present inside a class. In the code given above,

                                <h4>Java Environment</h4>
                                <p>We write programs in programming languages like Java which are called as High-level
                                    programming
                                    languages. But computers cannot understand high-level languages, they understand
                                    only binary
                                    language, i.e., 0's and 1's. This is the reason that every program that we write
                                    needs to get
                                    converted into binary form for the computer to understand.

                                    This conversion is made possible using system software called compilers and
                                    interpreters.</p>
                                <p>In Java, the program (source code) written by the programmer gets compiled and
                                    converted into byte
                                    code (compiled code) by the Java compiler.</p>
                                <p>All the byte codes required for the program are then given to the interpreter. The
                                    interpreter reads
                                    the byte code line by line, converts it to binary form, also called as machine
                                    language or binary
                                    language, and then executes it.</p>
                                <p>This process requires some support and an environment for the execution to happen.
                                    JDK (Java
                                    Development Kit) helps in this for execution of a Java program. It provides library
                                    support and Java
                                    Runtime Environment (JRE), the environment for developing and executing Java based
                                    applications and
                                    programs.</p>
                                <p>The program gets compiled and executed successfully if and only if it is written as
                                    per the syntax of
                                    the language.</p>


                                <h4>JDK in detail</h4>
                                <p>The development, compilation and execution of Java programs is taken care by JDK
                                    which contains 2
                                    main components: Development tools and JRE.</p>

                                <p>Let us first discuss about development tools. The development tools consist of Java
                                    compiler and Java
                                    launcher.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Java compiler (javac.exe) - It is the primary Java compiler. The compiler
                                        accepts Java source
                                        code and produces Java bytecode conforming to the Java Virtual Machine
                                        Specification (JVMS).
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Java launcher (java.exe) - It helps in launching a Java application during
                                        execution.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) contains Java Virtual Machine(JVM) and the Java
                                    standard library
                                    (Java Class Library).</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Java Virtual Machine (JVM) - It is the virtual machine that enables the computer
                                        to run Java
                                        programs.</li>
                                    <li>Java standard library (Java Class Library) - It is a set of dynamically loadable
                                        libraries that
                                        Java applications can call at run time. Java Platform is not dependent on a
                                        specific operating
                                        system and hence applications cannot rely on any of the platform-native
                                        libraries. So, the Java
                                        Platform provides a set of standard class libraries containing functions common
                                        to modern
                                        operating systems.</li>
                                </ul>


                                <h4>Execution of Java Program</h4>
                                <p>The below diagram shows various stages that a Java program goes through during
                                    execution.</p>
                                <p>The Java source code is saved in a file with .java extension. When we compile a Java
                                    program (.java
                                    file), .class files (byte code) with the same class names present in .java file are
                                    generated by the
                                    Java compiler (javac). These .class files go through various steps when we run the
                                    program as shown
                                    in the below diagram.</p>
                                <img src="img/j11.png" alt="" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid d-block img-size">
                                <p>Note:source codes (.java files) and byte codes (.class files)
                                </p>


                                <h4>Platform independence</h4>
                                <p>If a program written on a particular platform can run on other platforms without any
                                    recompilation,
                                    it is known as a platform independent program.</p>
                                <p>Usually larger applications are created by a team of developers. While most of them
                                    could be working
                                    on the same operating system such as Windows, others might be using different
                                    operating systems like
                                    Mac or Linux. In this scenario, we might have a situation where a program written on
                                    Windows needs
                                    to be executed on Mac OS also. </p>
                                <p>Since Java is platform independent, it is not a problem. A program written using Java
                                    on Windows will
                                    execute without any recompilation on any other platform.</p>

                                <p>Every programming language has a set of keywords which are reserved words having a
                                    predefined
                                    meaning. Each keyword represents a specific functionality in the language.</p>
                                <img src="img/j15.png" alt="" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid d-block img-size">
                                <h4>Variables</h4>
                                <p>Programs are mainly written to implement a functionality. Every program needs data
                                    and a mechanism to
                                    store this data.</p>
                                <p>Data is stored in variables. A variable is a named memory location which holds some
                                    value. The value
                                    stored in a variable can vary during the execution of the program.</p>
                                <p>In Java, it is necessary to declare a variable along with a data type before it can
                                    be used. </p>
                                <p>You can declare variables in Java as follows:</p>
                                <img src="img/j16.png" alt="" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid d-block img-size">
                                <h4>Identifiers</h4>
                                <p>Similarly, in Java, an identifier is the name given to a variable, method or class to
                                    uniquely
                                    identify it.
                                    In Java, following rules apply to the identifier name: </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>It can contain alphanumeric characters([a-z], [A-Z], [0-9]), dollar sign ($),
                                        underscore (_)
                                    </li>
                                    <li>It should not start with a digit ([0-9]) </li>
                                    <li>It should not have spaces </li>
                                    <li>It should not be a Java keyword </li>
                                    <li>It is case-sensitive </li>
                                    <li>It has no length restrictions </li>
                                </ul>
                                <h4>Datatypes</h4>
                                <p>Data type defines the type of data that can be stored in the variable and the memory
                                    required by it.
                                    There are two types of data types in Java: </p>
                                <img src="img/j17.png" alt="" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid d-block img-size">
                                <p>Primitive data types are the basic data types defined in Java. There are 8 primitive
                                    data types as
                                    shown in the below table. </p>
                                <img src="img/j18.png" alt="" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid d-block img-size">
                                <p>Here are some of the important points about primitive data types:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Numeric and boolean (true, false) values are written without quotes. E.g. int
                                        score = 85;
                                        boolean isQualified = true;</li>
                                    <li>The character value must be written in single quotes while assigning it to a
                                        character variable.
                                        E.g. char gender = 'M';</li>
                                    <li>A long value is assigned to the variable, suffixed with L (uppercase letter or
                                        lower case letter
                                        L can be used). E.g. long salary = 500000L; </li>
                                    <li>A float value must be suffixed with F or f while assigning to the variable. E.g.
                                        float average =
                                        78.6f;</li>
                                    <li>You will learn about different places in the program where the variables can be
                                        declared. As of
                                        now, note that the default values are not applicable to the variables declared
                                        inside a method.
                                        The variables declared inside a method must be initialized with a value before
                                        printing their

                                <p>Non-primitive data types include classes, arrays, interfaces etc. These can be
                                    predefined in Java
                                    library or user-defined in the programs. These will be covered in detail later in
                                    the course. </p>
                                <p>E.g. - String is a predefined class in Java library which is used to store a sequence
                                    of characters:
                                </p>

                                <h4>Coding Standards</h4>
                                <p>In Java, variable names should be nouns starting with lowercase letter. If it
                                    contains multiple
                                    words, then every inner word must start with capital letter. This type of casing is
                                    called camel
                                    casing.</p>
                                <p>Comments are those statements which are not executed by the compiler. Comments can be
                                    used to provide
                                    information about a variables or statement.

                                    There are two types of comments in Java:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Single line comment: //</li>
                                    <li>Multi-line comment:/* sth */</li>
                                </ul>

                                    be used for different purposes.</p>
                                <p>The operators are categorized as: </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Unary</li>

                                <h4>Bitwise Operators</h4>
                                <p>Bitwise operators are used to perform manipulation of individual bits of a number.
                                    Before we take a look at the different bitwise operators, let us understand how to
                                    convert a decimal
                                    number to binary number and vice versa.
                                    The decimal or the base 10 number system is used in everyday life but the binary
                                    number system is
                                    the basis for representing data in computing systems.</p>
                                <p>steps for decimal to binary</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Divide the decimal number by 2.</li>
                                    <li>Write the number on the right hand side. This will be either 1 or 0.</li>
                                    <li>Divide the result of the division and again by 2 and write the remainder.</li>
                                    <li>Continue this process until the result of the division is 0.</li>
                                    <li>The first remainder that you received is the least significant bit and the last
                                        remainder is the
                                        most significant bit.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>You will now see how to convert the binary number back to decimal number.

                                    The decimal number is equal to the sum of binary digits (dn) times their power of 2
                                    (2n).

                                    Lets take the example of 11001.</p>
                                <p>11001 = 1*24+1*23+0*22+0*21+1*20=16+8+0+0+1=25</p>
                                <p>You will now have a look at some of the bitwise operators and how they work.</p>
                                <strong>1)Bitwise OR(|)</strong>
                                <p>It returns bit by bit OR of the input values. If either of the bits is 1, then it
                                    gives 1, else it
                                    gives 0.

                                    E.g. - The output of 10 | 5 is 15.</p>
                                <img src="img/j25.png" alt="" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid d-block img-size">
                                <strong>Bitwise AND(&) </strong>
                                <p>It returns bit by bit AND of the input values. If both the bits are 1, then it gives
                                    1, else it gives
                                    0.

                                    E.g. - The output of 10 & 5 is 0.</p>
                                <img src="img/j26.png" alt="" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid d-block img-size">
                                <strong>Left shift operator(&lt&lt)</strong>
                                <p>It takes two operators and left shifts the bits of the first operand. The second
                                    operand decides the
                                    number of places to shift. It fills 0 on voids left as a result. </p>
                                <p>E.g. - The output of 10&lt&lt1 is 20 if the numbers are stored in 32 bit system.</p>
                                <p>10 is represented as 00000000 00000000 00000000 00001010.</p>
                                <p> After left shifting by 1 bit, the result becomes 00000000 00000000 00000000
                                    000010100 which is 20.
                                </p>
                                <p> The 0 that is highlighted is present because of the void.

                                    Similarly, the output of 10&lt&lt2 is 40.</p>
                                <strong>Signed Right shift operator(>>)</strong>
                                <p>It takes two operators and right shifts the bits of the first operand. The second
                                    operand decides the
                                    number of places to shift. It fills 0 on voids left as a result if the first operand
                                    is positive
                                    else it fills 1.</p>

                                <p>The output of 10>>1 is 5.
                                    10 is represented as 00000000 00000000 00000000 00001010.</p>

                                    which is 5.</p>

                                <p> The output of -10>>1 is -5.

                                <p>Operators also have precedence. The below table lists the operators according to the
                                    precedence from
                                    highest to lowest.

                                    Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before the operators with lower
                                    precedence. When an
                                    expression has two operators with the same precedence one after the other, the
                                    expression is
                                    evaluated according to their associativity. The associativity of operators can be
                                    left-to-right,
                                    right-to-left or no associativity.</p>

                                    of the datatype of the variable.</p>
                                <p>Whenever any operation is performed containing different data types, the data type of
                                    result is the
                                    largest data type in the expression.</p>
                                <p>For example, the result of (intVar + floatVar) will be a float value, the result of
                                    (intVar + longVar
                                    + doubleVar) will be a double value.</p>
                                <p>When you assign the value of one data type to another or when you perform operation
                                    on two operands,
                                    their data types must be compatible with each other. If the data types are not
                                    compatible, then the
                                    data type of an operand needs to be converted. </p>

                                <p>Implicit Type Conversion is also known as Widening conversion. It happens in the
                                    below scenarios:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>When a value of a data type with smaller range is assigned to a variable of a
                                        compatible data
                                        type with larger range. </li>
                                    <li>When two variables of different data types are involved in an expression, the
                                        value of smaller
                                        range datatype is converted to a value of larger range datatype and then the
                                        operation is
                                        performed. </li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>It is done automatically by the compiler; hence it is called as Implicit type
                                    conversion.</p>
                                <p>In Java, implicit type conversion happens as depicted in the diagram below. For
                                    example, if a short
                                    variable is assigned to int, long, float or double variable, it will get converted
                                    implicitly.</p>

                                <h4>Explicit Conversion</h4>
                                <p>Explicit Conversion is used when you want to assign a value of larger range data type
                                    to a smaller
                                    range data type. This conversion is not done by the compiler implicitly as there can
                                    be loss of data
                                    in some cases. Hence, programmer has to be cautious about such conversions. This is
                                    also known as
                                    Narrowing conversion. </p>

                                <p>You can also have else if statements. As the name suggests, it is a combination of
                                    else and if. Like
                                    else, it extends an if statement to execute a different set of statements in case
                                    the original if
                                    expression evaluates to false. Then, the conditions present inside the else if
                                    blocks are checked.
                                    Once a condition evaluates to true, remaining else if and else statements are
                                    skipped.

                                    When all the conditions are false, the else block is executed. Coding the else block
                                    is optional.

                                <h4>switch case</h4>
                                <p>Similar to if else statements, switch statement is also a selection control
                                    structure.

                                    The switch statement enables to select a block from a set of options. It allows the
                                    flow of
                                    execution to be switched according to a value.</p>
                                <p>During execution, the result of expression or variable written in the switch
                                    statement is compared
                                    with the constant values of cases one by one. When a match is found, the set of
                                    statements present
                                    in that case are executed until a break statement is encountered or till the end of
                                    switch block,
                                    whichever occurs first. In the absence of break statement, the flow of control falls
                                    through
                                    subsequent cases and executes the statements of all those cases until it reaches a
                                    break statement
                                    or end of switch block. </p>
                                <p>The switch block can have a special case called default. The default case is executed
                                    when none of
                                    the cases match with the value of expression/variable. default is optional. If none
                                    of the cases
                                    match and if there is no default statement, the control comes out of switch block
                                    without executing
                                    any case.</p>
                                <p>In Java, the switch block works only for the following data types:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>char and integral datatypes are supported in switch-case statement, but float or
                                        double are not
                                        supported.</li>
                                    <li>String datatype is also supported in switch-case statement from Java 7 version
                                        onwards.</li>

                                <p>Iteration control structures are used to execute a set of statements repeatedly. To
                                    terminate the
                                    repetition, a condition is required. </p>
                                <h4>while</h4>
                                <p>Similarly, in programming, when you want to repeatedly execute the statements as long
                                    as a condition
                                    is met, you can use the iteration control structure called while loop. When the
                                    condition becomes
                                    false, the while loop terminates and control goes to the statement written after the
                                    while loop. The
                                    while loop is used when the number of iterations are not known. In case of while
                                    loop, the condition
                                    is tested before entering the while loop block and hence it is known as
                                    an entry-controlled loop.

                                <p>break:break statement is used to terminate a loop. After terminating the loop, the
                                    next statement
                                    following the loop gets executed. In case of break statement written in nested
                                    loops, the inner most
                                    loop gets terminated and the flow of control continues with the statements of outer
                                    loop. 

                                    break statement is also used to terminate the execution of a switch case, as already
                                    discussed.</p>
                                <p>continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and continue with
                                    the next
                                    iteration. In case of while and do-while loops, continue statement skips the
                                    remaining code of the
                                    loop and passes the control to check the loop condition. Whereas in case of for
                                    loop, the control
                                    goes to the increment section and then the condition is checked.</p>

                                <h4>Need for Object Oriented Programming</h4>
                                <p>in structured programming where the focus is only on the functionality and not on the
                                    data or state
                                    of the real life entities. In structured programming approach, as the amount of data
                                    and complexity
                                    of functionality increases, it becomes difficult to manage the code.</p>
                                <p>Hence, there is a need for a programming paradigm which not only focuses on the
                                    functionality but
                                    also on the data or state of real life entities. This is possible with a different
                                    paradigm of
                                    programming known as Object Oriented Programming. </p>

                                <h4>Object Oriented Programming</h4>
                                <p>Object Oriented Programming(OOP) is a type of programming approach which enables the
                                    programmers to
                                    work with real life entities like Customer, Trainee, Employee, Company, Product,
                                    Food, Book, etc.
                                </p>
                                <p>Java, C#, Simula, JavaScript, Python, C++, Visual Basic .NET, Ruby, Scala, PHP etc.
                                    are some of the
                                    popular object-oriented programming languages.</p>
                                <p>OOP helps a programmer in breaking down the code into smaller modules. These modules
                                    (classes) will
                                    have state(represented by attributes/variables) and functionality (represented by
                                    behavior/methods).
                                </p>
                                <p>These modules can then be used for representing the individual real life entities
                                    known as objects.
                                </p>
                                <p>E.g. - We can have a class named Customer to represent the state and behavior of all
                                    customers. Each
                                    individual customer can then be represented using an object of the Customer class.
                                </p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Modularity: OOP enables programmers to create modules that do not need to be
                                        changed when an
                                        object is added.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>A programmer can simply create a new object to represent a new real-life
                                                entity.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Scalability: OOP makes development and maintenance easier. <ul>
                                            <li>Since the design is modular, part of the system can be updated in case
                                                of issues without
                                                a need to make large scale changes.</li>
                                            <li>In structured programming (like C language), it is not easy to manage
                                                the code as
                                                project size grows. These languages have functions that do not clearly
                                                segregate the
                                                functionality and attributes and makes it difficult for the programmer
                                                to understand the
                                                code.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Data hiding: OOP provides hiding and securing data.</li>
                                    <li>Real life scenario: OOP provides ability to simulate real world event more
                                        effectively and
                                        efficiently.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    behaviors. The class determines the attributes and behaviors which an object should
                                    possess to

                                <p>Till now, you have learnt that a class has a name and consists of instance variables
                                    and methods.

                                    Every instance variable has a data type and access modifier associated with it.</p>

                                <h5>Objects</h5>
                                <p>Once the class is ready, the next step is to create instances of the class which can
                                    represent real
                                    life entities. These instances are called as objects of the class.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>An object is an instance of a class</li>
                                    <li>An object holds data for every instance variable of a class</li>
                                    <li>It allows us to use the instance variables and methods specified in the class
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Any number of objects can be created for a class</li>

                                <p>In Java, an object of a class is created using the new keyword.</p>
                                <p>Objects of a class are usually created outside that class. For creating the Customer
                                    object, create a

                                    <li>Once an object is created, the object's methods and attributes can be invoked

                                    <li>Class names in Java should follow pascal case.E.g. - Customer, RegularCustomer,

                                    <li>Method names and variables in Java should follow camel case.E.g. - customerName,

                                <p>Consider the scenario where we have many customers. We would have to initialize each
                                    attribute of
                                    each object as shown above. This process would be much simpler if we had some other
                                    way of
                                    initializing all the members of an object while creating the object. This can be
                                    achieved by
                                    constructors. </p>
                                <p>A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize class variables
                                    at the time of
                                    object creation. </p>
                                <p>Each time an object is created using the new() keyword, a constructor is called. A
                                    constructor can be
                                    created by the programmer. If the developer does not create any constructor, then,
                                    Java provides a
                                    default constructor. </p>
                                <p>In the previous examples, we had not created any constructor, but Java provided a
                                    default constructor
                                    for every class</p>

                                <p>A new Customer object referenced by customerObj will be created in the memory.

                                    But how does it happen?

                                    The memory is logically divided into two primary sections - Stack and Heap.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>All local variables and method invocations are stored in the stack</li>
                                    <li>All objects along with their instance variables are stored in the heap</li>
                                </ul>
                                <img src="img/j42.PNG" alt="" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid d-block img-size">
                                <p>Please note that reference variables are also local variables. Reference variables
                                    are local
                                    variables which stores the address of another memory location.</p>

                                    <li>One reference variable can point to one and only one object at a time.</li>
                                    <li>One object can be referenced by multiple reference variables at any given point

                                <h4>Memory deallocation</h4>
                                <p>Now that you have learnt how memory allocation happens, it is also important to know
                                    the process of
                                    deallocating the memory.</p>
                                <p>Sometimes, even though a resource in a program is unreachable or not in use, the
                                    memory used by that
                                    resource is not deallocated. This is called Memory leak and is undesirable.</p>
                                <p>In some languages, it is the programmer's responsibility for deallocating the memory
                                    occupied by such
                                    resources. Java, on the other hand, has a garbage collector which automatically
                                    deallocates the
                                    memory used by such resources. This prevents memory leak.</p>
                                <p>When an object does not have any reference, it becomes eligible for garbage
                                    collection.</p>
                                <p>You might be wondering when does an object not have any reference and become eligible
                                    for garbage
                                    collection?</p>
                                <strong>Case 1 - Objects eligible for garbage collection</strong>
                                <p>When the reference variable pointing to the object is initialized to null, the object
                                    will not have
                                    any reference.</p>

                                                getter methods.</li>
                                            <li>Getter methods are also known as accessor methods and setter methods are
                                                also known as
                                                mutator methods.</li>

                                <p>This way of restricting access to data is called encapsulation.
                                    Encapsulation is one of the basic principles of OOP.</p>
                                <p>Here, the variables of a particular class are hidden from other classes. We can
                                    access these
                                    variables only through the methods of the class. Hence, it is also referred as data
                                    hiding.</p>

                                <p>Since we cannot access private variables outside the class, we need to have public
                                    setter and getter
                                    methods. The getter and setter methods have now been added to the code. Observe how

                                <h3>Abstraction</h3>
                                <p>Abstraction is the process of exposing only relevant details. Let us consider the
                                    example of
                                    withdrawing money from ATM. We insert the ATM card and follow certain steps to
                                    withdraw money. We
                                    just ensure that we collect correct amount of cash and correct amount gets deducted
                                    from the
                                    balance. We need not know the internal working of the ATM to withdraw money. Here,
                                    the internal
                                    working of the ATM is abstracted from the end-users.</p>
                                <p>Similarly, objects in OOP provide an abstraction that hides the internal
                                    implementation details. You
                                    just need to know the methods that are available to call and the input parameters
                                    required to call a
                                    method but you don’t need to know how the method is implemented.</p>
                                <p>Given below is a small example about how abstraction is implemented in Java. Here, we
                                    are invoking
                                    methods (withdraw() and balance() methods of Account class) without knowing the
                                    logic of the
                                    methods.</p>

                        account.withdraw(2000); // Passing the amount to be withdrawn

                                <h4>Abstraction - Tryout</h4>
                                <p>Let us consider the example of customer paying the bill for an order. Here, payBill
                                    method accepts
                                    totalPrice and discount as parameters and calculates the final price to be paid by
                                    the customer.
                                </p>
                                <p>When we invoke the payBill() using a Customer object, we don’t have to know the
                                    internal working of
                                    the method to invoke it. This ability to use something without having to know the
                                    details of how it
                                    is working is called as abstraction.</p>

                                    A class diagram is a diagram that is used to visualize the different aspects of a
                                    class. It can be
                                    used to define the structure of the classes and the relationship among them. Class
                                    diagram is the
                                    only UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagram which can be directly mapped to object
                                    oriented
                                    languages and therefore, is one of the most widely used UML diagrams.</p>
                                <p>In a class diagram, a class is represented by a rectangular box along with the
                                    attributes and methods
                                    of the class</p>
                                <p>Below is the class diagram of a class Customer which represents a customer of the

                                    containing various attributes and methods.</p>

                                <h3>String</h3>
                                <p>You have already seen that String is used to store a sequence of characters. String
                                    is a predefined
                                    class in Java and comes with many methods which can help us perform various
                                    operations on it. </p>
                                <p>There are two ways to create a string:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>String literal : String customerName = "Jasmine"; </li>
                                    <li>Using new() keyword : String customerName = new String("Jasmine"); </li>
                                </ul>
                                <h4>String literal</h4>
                                <p>Every time you create a string literal, the JVM checks the String constant pool.
                                    String constant pool
                                    in Java is a pool of Strings stored in Heap memory. If the string exists in the
                                    pool, then a
                                    reference to the existing literal is returned. If the string is not found, then a
                                    new instance is
                                    created and placed in the pool. </p>
                                <p>In the below diagram, since the value of newName is also Max, new memory is not
                                    allocated for newName
                                    and newName points to the same memory location as name does.

                                    In the below case, name==newName will be true.</p>
                                <img src="img/j51.png" alt="" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid d-block img-size">

                                <h4>String object</h4>
                                <p>Strings behave a bit differently when a new instance of String class is created. When
                                    you create a
                                    string using the new() keyword, JVM places the literal in the constant pool and also
                                    creates a new
                                    string object in heap memory. The reference variable points to the object in the
                                    heap memory.</p>
                                <p>In the below example, either 1 or 2 strings will be created. If there is already a
                                    string literal
                                    "Welcome" in the pool, then only one string will be created. If there is no string
                                    literal "Welcome"
                                    in the pool, then it will be first created in the pool and then in the heap memory
                                    resulting in
                                    creation of 2 String objects.

                                    In the below case, str == newStr will be false.</p>

                                <p>Here, we have assumed that a restaurant will have only one contact number.

                                    What if the restaurant has multiple contact numbers?</p>

                                <p> How can we store multiple contact numbers of a restaurant?

                                    One solution to this problem is to create more instance variables to store multiple
                                    contact numbers
                                    and initialize it with different values.</p>

                                <h3>Unit Testing</h3>
                                <p>You have been writing code but it is very important to deliver a bug free code.</p>
                                <p>Testing is the process of checking the functionality of an application to ensure that
                                    it runs as per
                                    requirements and does not have a bug.</p>
                                <p>It is the responsibility of the developer to test the module or method that he/she
                                    has developed
                                    before the code is integrated with others code.</p>
                                <p>Testing of single small units of code such as a method or a class is called unit
                                    testing.

                                    So, it is the responsibility of the developers to deliver a unit tested code. It
                                    plays a critical
                                    role in delivering quality products to customers.

                                    Unit testing can be done manually or can be automated using tools.</p>

                                <h4>Unit Test Case</h4>
                                <p>Unit testing is performed using unit test cases.

                                    A unit test case is a part of code, which ensures that another part of code (method)
                                    works as
                                    expected.

                                    A unit test case is characterized by a known input and an expected output, which is
                                    worked out
                                    before the test is executed. </p>
                                <p>There must be at least two unit test cases for each requirement − one positive test
                                    and one negative
                                    test. If a requirement has sub-requirements, each sub-requirement must have at least
                                    two test cases
                                    as positive and negative.</p>
                                <p>To achieve the desired results quickly, a test framework is required. There are
                                    several frameworks
                                    available for automating unit tests. JUnit and TestNG are among the popular ones for
                                    Java.</p>

                                <h5>Why do we need Static?</h5>
                                <p>Though the delivery charge is same for all the customer objects, but in this case,
                                    the value of
                                    delivery charge is maintained for each and every customer object</p>
                                <p>So, instead of storing the delivery charge separately for each and every customer
                                    object, it would
                                    have been better if we could have maintained a single copy of the delivery charge
                                    which could be
                                    accessible by all the customer objects.</p>
                                <p>Usually, values of member variables can be accessed only by that object. But here, we
                                    need a variable
                                    whose value could be shared by all the objects of a class, i.e., the entire class.
                                </p>
                                <p>In, object oriented programming languages like Java, there is a concept of creating a
                                    static
                                    variable. A static variable belongs to an entire class and not to a specific object.
                                </p>

                                <h4>Static variable</h4>
                                <p>When a variable is declared as Static, then a single copy of the variable is created
                                    and shared among
                                    all objects at the class level. Memory allocation for such variables happen only
                                    once when the class
                                    is loaded in the memory. These variables are also known as class-level variables.
                                </p>
                                <p>Since static variables and instance variables are both members of the class, they are
                                    often referred
                                    to as member variables.</p>
                                <h5>Declaration of Static variable</h5>
                                <p>To create a static member variable, precede its declaration with the keyword static.
                                    When a member is
                                    declared static, it can be accessed before any object of the class is created and
                                    without reference
                                    to any object. </p>

                                <p>Since the static variable gets created only once, now only one deliveryCharge member

                                <p>To update or retrieve the value of a static variable, you need to use the setter and
                                    getter methods.
                                </p>
                                <p>Since static variable is not specific to an object, you need a way to access the
                                    setter and getter
                                    methods without an object. This is possible by creating static methods.</p>

                                <h5>How to use static methods</h5>
                                <p>Static methods are methods prefixed with the static keyword. These methods can be
                                    accessed without an
                                    object of the class. Similar to static variables, they are accessed using the class
                                    name. A static
                                    method can be invoked without creating an instance of a class.</p>
                                <p>A static method can only access static variables and cannot access instance
                                    variables.</p>
                                <p>In case of the delivery charge scenario, you can create static setter and getter
                                    methods for
                                    deliveryCharge as shown below</p>

                                <p>Another most common implementation of the static concept is in auto-generation of
                                    Ids.</p>
                                <p>Let us assume that we want to generate the customer Ids for all the customers. All
                                    the customer Ids
                                    must be unique and it should start with 'C101'. In order to implement this
                                    requirement and generate
                                    the customerId for all the customers, the concept of static is used as shown below.

                                <h4>Introduction to Relationships</h4>
                                <p>So far, we have been dealing with classes and objects which don’t interact with other
                                    classes, but in
                                    real life, objects interact with objects of other classes. Let us look at an
                                    example: </p>
                                <img src="img/j59.png" alt="" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid d-block img-size">
                                <p>Here, Student and Hostel both are separate classes having their own existence. They
                                    both are related
                                    to each other as a Student 'lives in' a Hostel. </p>
                                <p>Below are some other examples that show how different classes may be related to each
                                    other: </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Employee drinks Coffee </li>
                                    <li>Customer buys a Phone </li>
                                    <li>College has a Department </li>
                                    <li>Car has a Wheel </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>In OOP, two classes can communicate with each other using their objects. An object
                                    may communicate
                                    with another object to use the functionalities provided by the other object. This is
                                    very helpful if
                                    we want to reuse the members of a class in another. Some of the types of
                                    relationships in Java are:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Aggregation </li>
                                    <li>Association </li>
                                    <li>Inheritance </li>
                                </ul>

                                <h4>Aggregation</h4>
                                <p>Aggregation which is also known as Has-a relationship. This kind of relationship
                                    exists between two
                                    classes when a reference variable of one class is a member variable in another
                                    class. Consider the
                                    below examples. </p>
                                <p>Example 1: - Consider a class Department. Department will have various member
                                    variables like
                                    department name, department Id. Apart from these member variables, a department also
                                    has a manager.
                                    This manager is actually an Employee and will have different set of member
                                    variables. The member
                                    variable manager in the Department class will be a reference of Employee class. In
                                    this case, we can
                                    say, Department has a manager (Employee) which is an Aggregation relationship.</p>

                                <p>Example 2: - Consider a Library class. A library has many books. Each book will have
                                    its own set of
                                    characteristics and hence, Book will be a separate class. In the Library class, book
                                    will be a
                                    member variable and will be of the type Book class. In this case also, we can say,
                                    Library has books
                                    which is also an Aggregation relationship.</p>

                                <p>Here, you can observe that the variable orderedFood acts like any other member
                                    variable and can be
                                    directly accessed using the Order object. In order to access the members of the Food
                                    class using the
                                    reference variable of Order class, we can make use of dot '.' just like any other
                                    reference variable
                                    shown above. </p>
                                <p>You have seen how an object of one class can be used in another class. In Order
                                    class, the instance
                                    variable orderedFoods is of type Food. In the SwiftFood scenario, we can have more
                                    than one food
                                    item in a particular order. To store more than one Food objects we can make use of
                                    an array.

                                <p>Association, also known as uses-a relationship exists between two classes when one
                                    object makes use
                                    of another object for its functionality. Here, both the objects can exist

                                <p>Example 1: - Consider a class Patient. A patient needs to take an appointment to
                                    visit the hospital.
                                    Appointment and Patient are separate classes. Also, an appointment cannot be
                                    categorized as one of
                                    the attributes of the patient. Rather this appointment is only used by the patient
                                    and is said to
                                    have Association relationship. </p>

                                    Bill. This method is used to generate bill for a particular order. Here, a reference
                                    of an Order
                                    object is passed to the method as shown in the class diagram below.
                                </p>

                                <p>Note: In class diagram, Association is represented by an arrow as shown below. When

                                <p>Though Regular customers, Premium customers and Guests have different billing
                                    mechanism, they have
                                    some common attributes like customerId, customerName, contactNumber and address.</p>
                                <p>So, instead of keeping the common attributes in each and every class, we can have a
                                    common class
                                    called Customer and include the common attributes. </p>
                                <h4>is-A relationship</h4>
                                <p>Now, let us consider RegularCustomer and Guest classes. Since RegularCustomer and
                                    Guest are types of
                                    Customers, they must have access to the common attributes also. We can create a
                                    Customer class with
                                    the common attributes and methods and make these two classes inherit the attributes
                                    and behavior
                                    from Customer class as shown below.
                                </p>
                                <img src="img/j68.png" alt="" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid d-block img-size">
                                <p>The common members that are inherited are represented using blue color. The members
                                    specific to
                                    RegularCustomer and Guest are represented using green color.</p>
                                <p>We can say that the RegularCustomer "is-A" Customer and Guest "is-A" Customer. When a
                                    class inherits
                                    from another class, then those classes are said to have inheritance relationship.
                                    The class which is
                                    inheriting is called the child/sub/derived class and the class which is getting
                                    inherited is called
                                    the parent/super/base class. Inheritance is also called as "is-A" relationship.
                                    Inheritance (is-a)
                                    is denoted by a line with an arrow head. </p>
                                <p>In our example, RegularCustomer and Guest classes are inheriting the Customer class.
                                    So, Customer is
                                    the parent class and RegularCustomer and Guest are child classes. </p>
                                <h4>What gets inherited?</h4>
                                <p>In case of an inheritance relationship, the attributes and behaviors get inherited
                                    just like a child
                                    inherits certain attributes and behaviors from his/her parent. </p>
                                <p>In terms of OOP, a child class inherits all the non-private attributes and methods.
                                </p>
                                <p>When we say a child class inherits the attributes and methods, we can treat the
                                    attributes and
                                    methods as if they are owned by the child class itself.</p>
                                <h4>extends keyword</h4>
                                <p>In Java, a child class inherits the parent class using the "extends" keyword. Observe
                                    the below code.
                                </p>

                                <p>Let us take one more example. In an organization, we have employees of different
                                    designations. Let us
                                    consider Project Manager and System Engineer. All the employees have common
                                    attributes like Id, name
                                    and email id. So, we can have a common class called Employee and include these
                                    attributes. The

                                <h4>Constructor call in Inheritance</h4>
                                <p>By now, you have learnt that the derived classes inherit from the base class. You
                                    will now see how
                                    the child class object is created. As you all know, constructors are invoked while
                                    creating objects.
                                    When a child class object is created, the child class constructor invokes the parent
                                    class
                                    constructor before executing any statement present in the child constructor.

                                    Observe the below code and understand the sequence of constructor invocation.

                                    <li>Code reusability - The codes are defined only once and can be used multiple
                                        times. We define the
                                        functionalities in the parent class and any number of child classes can use the
                                        functionalities
                                        at any time.</li>
                                    <li>Saves time and effort due to reusability of code.</li>
                                    <li>Inheritance makes the application code more flexible to changes</li>
                                    <li>Inheritance results in better organization of codes into smaller and simpler
                                        compilation units
                                        which makes the code more readable and easy to debug</li>

                                <p>Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take different forms, i.e., a single
                                    action that can be
                                    performed in different ways. So, polymorphism means many forms.</p>

                                    customers.</p>
                                <p>But are they all providing it at the same rate?</p>
                                <p>No, rate of interest may differ from bank to bank. So, object of the Bank class may
                                    behave
                                    differently when we try to get the interest rate for bank loans (through a method).
                                </p>
                                <p>The Bank class, here, shows polymorphism.</p>

                                <h4>Polymorphism - Scenario</h4>
                                <p>Consider the SwiftFood scenario in which a Customer is ordering food online.

                                    Based on the different types of customers, the final price and thus the payment of
                                    bill gets
                                    changed. This is because, the Guests are charged a delivery charge of $2.0 and other
                                    registered
                                    customers get some discounts. Among them, Regular Customer gets a discount of 5% and
                                    Premium
                                    Customers 8%. Premium Customers also have a provision to pay the bill using their
                                    membership card
                                    points.

                                </p>
                                <p>So, the final payment of the bill differs for each of the customers. Thus, Customer
                                    class also
                                    exhibits polymorphism.</p>
                                <p>Polymorphishm is of two types:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Static polymorphism</li>
                                    <li>Dynamic polymorphism</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h4>Static Polymorphism</h4>
                                <p>Polymorphism that gets resolved during compile time is known as static polymorphism
                                    or compile time
                                    polymorphism. This polymorphism is achieved using overloading of the methods in the
                                    same class,
                                    called as Method overloading.</p>
                                <p>Method overloading allows the programmer to have multiple methods with the same name
                                    in the same
                                    class, but differing in their signature.</p>
                                <p>Signature can differ by</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>the number of parameters</li>
                                    <li>the data type of parameters</li>
                                    <li>the order of the parameters</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Note: We cannot overload methods by their return type, i.e., two or more methods are
                                    not overloaded
                                    if they differ only in their return type.</p>

                                <h5>Static polymorphism - Scenario</h5>
                                <p>Consider the scenario where the customer of SwiftFood app needs to update his or her
                                    contact number.
                                    For this requirement, we will have a method updateContact(long mobile) as follows:
                                </p>
                                <button class="btn btn-primary" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse"

                                    Code
                                </button>
                                </p>
                                <div class="collapse" id="i102">
                                    <div class="card card-body">
                                        <pre><code>
            
                public class Customer {
                    private String customerId;
                    private String customerName;
                    private long contactNumber;
                    private Address address;
                    public void updateContact(long mobile) {
                        System.out.println("Updating customer contact number...");
                        this.setContactNumber(mobile);
                    }
                    // Constructors and other methods
                }
                
            
            </code></pre>
                                    </div>
                                </div>
                                <p>Let us assume that later, the app provides another feature for the customers to
                                    change their address
                                    so that they can provide another delivery location.

                                    Now, we will add another method, updateAddress(Address address) as given below:</p>
                                <button class="btn btn-primary" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse"
                                    data-bs-target="#i103" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="i103">
                                    Code
                                </button>
                                </p>
                                <div class="collapse" id="i103">
                                    <div class="card card-body">
                                        <pre><code>
            
                public class Customer {
                    private String customerId;
                    private String customerName;
                    private long contactNumber;
                    private Address address;
                    public void updateContact(long mobile) {
                        System.out.println("Updating customer contact number...");
                        this.setContactNumber(mobile);
                    }
                    public void updateAddress(Address address) {
                        System.out.println("Updating customer address...");
                        this.setAddress(address);
                    }
                    // Constructors and other methods
                }
                
            
            </code></pre>
                                    </div>
                                </div>
                                <p>So, here different methods are getting added to the code which are basically doing
                                    the same thing of
                                    updating the customer details which can be either contact number or address or any
                                    other details</p>
                                <p>Thus, is there any need of having these methods with a different name?</p>
                                <p>No, since we have the option of creating overloaded methods, i.e., methods with same
                                    name differing
                                    in signature, we can use overloaded methods in this scenario.</p>
                                <p>Here, the advantage is that we don’t have to create and remember different names for
                                    methods doing
                                    same functionality. For example, if overloading was not supported, we would have to
                                    create different
                                    method names like updateContact, updateAddress, updateContactAddress etc.</p>
                                <p>Considering this, our code will be modified as shown below:</p>

                                <p>Here, the Customer class is having two methods (having same behavior of updating the

                                    parameter. This is Method Overloading and both the updateDetails methods are said to

                                <p>Just like normal methods, constructors can also be overloaded, i.e., a class can have
                                    multiple
                                    constructors. This is called constructor overloading. Remember that you have already
                                    seen a class
                                    having multiple constructors.

                                    The below code demonstrates constructor overloading.</p>

                                <h4>Dynamic Polymorphism</h4>
                                <p>Similar to static polymorphism or compile time polymorphism, polymorphism can also be
                                    achieved at
                                    runtime. Such type of polymorphism is known as dynamic polymorphism. This type of
                                    polymorphism is
                                    achieved using overriding the parent method in the child class, called as Method
                                    Overriding.</p>
                                <p>Overriding feature allows the programmer to have a different implementation of parent
                                    methods with
                                    the same signature in the child classes. Such parent methods are said to be
                                    overridden.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>When we override a method in the child class, it should have the same signature
                                        as that of the
                                        parent class.</li>
                                    <li>The method should not have a weaker access modifier.</li>
                                    <li>Private methods are not overridden.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>You have already seen the inheritance hierarchy in the SwiftFood app. </p>

                                <h5>Need for method overriding</h5>
                                <p>Consider the parent Customer class. </p>
                                <p>All the customers’ need to pay the bill amount calculated for their orders. There is
                                    a payBill() in
                                    the Customer class for calculating the final amount for bill payment.</p>
                                <p>You need to also remember that calculation of bill amount differs for each type of
                                    customer. Guests
                                    needs to pay a delivery charge of $2. Regular customers get a discount of 5%.
                                    Premium customers get
                                    a discount of 8% and they can use membership card points for paying the bill.</p>
                                <p>Since the final amount calculation which is done in the payBill() of parent Customer
                                    class will not
                                    suit for all the customer types, we need to have separate implementation for this
                                    method in each of
                                    the child classes with respect to each customer type.</p>
                                <p>So, in this scenario, the payBill() of the child classes will override the
                                    implementation of
                                    payBill() present in the parent class. This is said to be method overriding.</p>

                                <p>This is called an annotation. It is like an information for the compiler or JVM and
                                    provides
                                    additional meaning to the code.</p>
                                <p>An annotation is a meta-data that provides data about the program and is not part of
                                    the program
                                    itself.</p>
                                <p>Its purpose is to give additional information to the compiler, or for some processing
                                    during
                                    compile-time or runtime. It can be added to classes, methods, variables, parameters
                                    and packages.
                                </p>
                                <p>The @Override annotation is used with methods which ensures that the method is
                                    actually overriding a
                                    parent method. If it is used on a method which does not override any parent method,
                                    a compilation
                                    error occurs.
                                </p>
                                <p>What happens, if @Override annotation is not used with an overridden method?</p>
                                <p>While it is not required to use this annotation when overriding a method, it helps to
                                    prevent errors.
                                    If a method marked with @Override fails to correctly override a method from one of
                                    its super
                                    classes, the compiler generates an error.</p>
                                <p>Not having this annotation can cause warnings. But having this annotation with no
                                    super class that
                                    has a same method signature will result in an error.</p>
                                <p>@Override annotation helps in avoiding refactoring errors. If the method in the super
                                    class is
                                    renamed, but not the overridden method, then also it will give an error.</p>

                                <h4>Super</h4>
                                <p>You have already seen that super keyword can be used to invoke the constructors of
                                    parent class.</p>
                                <p>super keyword can also be used for</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>invoking a parent class method from a child class method </li>
                                    <li>accessing a parent class instance variable in the child class in case there is a
                                        variable in the

                                </ul>
                                <h5>super - Scenario</h5>
                                <p>Consider the PremiumCustomer class which is the child class of RegularCustomer.

                                    While calculating the final bill to be paid for the premium customer, discount needs
                                    to be applied
                                    but the discount value is different from that of a regular customer.</p>
                                <p>The code for PremiumCustomer class is as shown below:</p>

                                <p>super is used in the child class constructor to call the parent class constructor.

                                <p>Now consider the payBill() method in which final bill is calculated after applying

                                    applying discount is done in the payBill() method of the parent class, i.e.,

                                </p>
                                <p>This redundant calculation can be avoided by calling the parent class method in the

                                    calculated and returned to the payBill() method of the PremiumCustomer class.</p>

                                <p>Let us have a look at one more code snippet.
                                </p>
                                <p>In the above given code, salary attribute is present in both the parent (Employee)
                                    and the child
                                    (Manager) but the salary component of Manager class will be having an additional
                                    component of bonus.
                                    In order to calculate the actual salary of the manager, fixed salary of the Employee
                                    class is
                                    required.</p>
                                <p>Thus, in order to access the instance variable of the parent class inside the child
                                    class, super is
                                    used.</p>

                                <h4>Comparison of Method Overloading and Method Overriding</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Method overloading is a feature through which a class can have multiple methods
                                        with the same
                                        name but different signature.</li>
                                    <li>Method overriding is a feature that allows a subclass or child class to have a
                                        method with the
                                        same name and signature as that of the parent class.</li>
                                    <li>Overloading is an example of compile-time polymorphism as the decision about
                                        which method has to
                                        be invoked is taken during compilation time.</li>
                                    <li>Overriding is an example of runtime polymorphism as the decision about which
                                        method has to be
                                        invoked is taken during runtime.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p> in Java, there is an Object class which is the implicit super class of all classes.

                                <p>It provides useful methods which can be overridden according to our requirement.</p>

                                <p>Let us revisit the Object class hierarchy in Java.</p>
                                <img src="img/j77.png" alt="" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid d-block img-size">

                                <h5>Wrapper Class</h5>
                                <p>The primitive data types in Java do not inherit the Object class as they are not
                                    classes but
                                    sometimes, it is required to convert data types into objects in Java programming.
                                </p>
                                <p>To convert data types into objects and to inherit the Object class, Java has Boolean,
                                    Character,
                                    Integer, Long, Float and Double classes which are called as Wrapper Class.</p>
                                <p>Wrapper classes help in representing the primitive data types as an object. They form
                                    a wrapping
                                    around the primitive values to represent them as objects.</p>
                                <p>They belong to the java.lang package as part of the Java library.</p>
                                <p>Wherever, the data type is required as an object, the objects of the Wrapper classes
                                    can be used.
                                    Wrapper classes include methods to unwrap the object and give back the data type.
                                </p>

                                <p>Customer class in the SwiftFood app scenario has a payBill method. The implementation
                                    of this method
                                    completely depends on the type of customer. So, we implemented this method in all
                                    our customer types
                                    (child classes) by overriding the parent method.</p>
                                <p>Thus, the parent class method implementation doesn’t actually have any significance
                                    but it is
                                    necessary for all the child classes to provide a proper implementation for the
                                    method.</p>

                                <p> So, this means the parent class Customer will not have any implementation for the
                                    payBill method but
                                    we need to enforce that the child classes implement the payBill() method.
                                </p>
                                <p>This can be enforced with the help of abstract keyword as shown below.</p>

                                <p>Since it cannot have any implementation, it has been marked as abstract.</p>
                                <p>Since the method payBill is abstract in the Customer class, the class itself becomes

                                    demands for a child class to complete it.</p>
                                <p>For marking the class as incomplete, abstract keyword is used with the class also.
                                    Any class
                                    extending this abstract class must provide the implementation of the abstract

                                <p>Some points that you should be knowing about abstract class are:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>An abstract class encapsulates the common behaviors of all its child classes
                                        with the help of
                                        abstract methods</li>
                                    <li>Concrete (non-abstract) classes which extend an abstract class must implement
                                        all the abstract
                                        methods. Otherwise, they should be made abstract as well.</li>
                                    <li>If a class contains at least one abstract method, the class should be abstract.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>A class can be made abstract even without any abstract methods.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h4>Abstraction and dynamic binding</h4>
                                <p>We know a parent class reference can refer to a child class object. So, if a
                                    reference belongs to an
                                    abstract class, you can be sure that the object it refers to will always be of its
                                    child type.</p>
                                <img src="img/j81.png" alt="" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid d-block img-size">
                                <p>Thus, abstract classes enforce inheritance (since they can’t be instantiated)

                                    and

                                    abstract methods enforce overriding (since they are incomplete with no
                                    implementation)</p>

                                        abstract</li>
                                    <li>An interface creates a type. Hence, its reference can be used to refer to the
                                        objects of the
                                        classes which implement that interface. This leads to dynamic binding</li>
                                    <li>Since Java 8, an interface can also have default and static methods. This is not
                                        discussed in
                                        this course</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Observe the below code. The interface specifies the behaviors by declaring methods
                                    but does not
                                    provide the implementations. Using interface, we specify what is to be done without
                                    telling how.

                                <p>It would be better if user-friendly and meaningful error messages can be shown to the

                                <p>This can be done by handling the errors properly.</p>
                                <p>The runtime errors shown previously are called as exceptions and the process of
                                    handling the
                                    exceptions is known as Exception Handling.</p>
                                <h4>try - catch block</h4>
                                <p>In order to handle exceptions, the first step is to identify the code which may
                                    generate exceptions.
                                    The set of statements that may generate an exception are enclosed in a block known
                                    as try block. The
                                    try block contains a set of statements where an exception can occur.</p>
                                <p>The second step is to handle those exceptions. In order to handle those exceptions
                                    which get raised
                                    in the try block, we use the catch block. A catch block is where you handle the
                                    exceptions, i.e.,
                                    the catch block specifies what is to be done when an exception occurs.</p>
                                <p>A try block is always followed by a catch block.

                                <p>This is because the present catch block can handle only ArithmeticException whereas
                                    the
                                    implementations of calculateAverage() may also encounters
                                    ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. In order
                                    to resolve this exception, we have to create one more catch block having the
                                    exception type as
                                    ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.</p>
                                <p>In Java, a single try block can have several catch blocks associated with it. You can
                                    catch different
                                    exceptions in different catch blocks. When an exception occurs in the try block, one
                                    of the
                                    corresponding catch blocks that handles that particular exception executes. For
                                    example, if an
                                    arithmetic exception occurs in try block then the statements enclosed in the catch
                                    block for
                                    arithmetic exception executes.</p>

                                <p>Exceptions get generated mainly in two ways:</p>
                                <p>1)Automatically by the compiler or JVM when an exceptional situation is detected or
                                    has occurred.</p>
                                <p>Usually, a certain input or a programming mistake or an overlook can lead to such
                                    exceptions</p>
                                <button class="btn btn-primary" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse"
                                    data-bs-target="#i153" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="i153">
                                    Code
                                </button>
                                </p>
                                <div class="collapse" id="i153">

                int num = numArray[i];     // ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if i exceeds the array capacity

                                <p>2)Manually by the programmer to denote exceptional situations as defined by the
                                    business</p>
                                <p>For example, invalid payment mode is an exception and hence, this situation needs to
                                    be denoted
                                    manually.</p>
                                <p>There are two different types of exceptions in Java:</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Checked Exception</li>
                                    <li>Unchecked Exception</li>
                                </ul>

                                <strong>Checked Exception</strong>
                                <p>All exceptions other than runtime exceptions are known as Checked Exceptions as the
                                    compiler checks
                                    them during compilation to see whether the programmer has handled them or not. If
                                    these exceptions
                                    are not handled/declared in the program, you will get a compilation error. In this
                                    case, the
                                    programmers are forced to either handle these exceptions or declare to allow their
                                    propagation.</p>
                                <p> E.g. - SQLException, IOException, etc. are Checked Exceptions</p>
                                <strong>Unchecked Exception</strong>
                                <p>Unchecked exceptions are runtime exceptions. These exceptions are not checked at
                                    compile-time. So,
                                    the compiler does not check whether the programmer has handled them or not. In this
                                    case, the
                                    programmers are not forced to handle or declare their propagation.</p>
                                <p>E.g. - ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException,
                                    etc. are Unchecked
                                    Exceptions</p>
                                <h4>Exception Hierarchy</h4>
                                <p>You have seen that in catch block, we had used ArithmeticException and
                                    ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. ArithmeticException and
                                    ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException are classes
                                    in Java. Similarly, there are multiple other classes for representing exceptions.

                                    The hierarchy of the exception classes is shown in the below diagram.</p>
                                <p>All the exceptions inherit the Exception class, which is a child of the Throwable
                                    class. </p>
                                <img src="img/j85.png" alt="" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid d-block img-size">
                                <p>You will now understand the importance of Throwable class.</p>


                                <h4>throw</h4>
                                <p>Let us consider a scenario of populating the marks of 3 subjects for a student. Let
                                    us assume that
                                    the programmer has wrongly given one subject’s marks as -65.

                                    Is it possible to have marks as -65?

                                    Obviously not!</p>
                                <p>Logically, this should not be the value of the accepted marks but the previous
                                    program will not raise
                                    any exception and average marks will be calculated with the wrong value.</p>
                                <p>Why does the program not raise an exception in this case?</p>
                                <p>The exception does not get raised because this marks being invalid is not one of the
                                    exception types
                                    that Java has defined. Here, if we want to raise an exception for negative marks,
                                    then we have to
                                    raise it manually.</p>
                                <p>In Java, we can define our own set of conditions or rules and throw an exception
                                    explicitly using
                                    throw keyword.
                                </p>
                                <p>For example, we can throw the exception if the value of the marks is negative using
                                    throw keyword.

                                <p>In the previous try out, the negative marks exception was of type Exception. It would
                                    have been
                                    better if we could have differentiated the negative marks exception the way we were
                                    able to
                                    differentiate ArithmeticException from ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. </p>
                                <p>To make an application more flexible and manageable, Java allows us to have our own
                                    custom
                                    exceptions. This helps in working with specialized exceptions rather than a general
                                    one.</p>
                                <p>We can create a user-defined exception class by extending the Exception class:

                                <p>Till now we have defined the try-catch block in the method definition where the

                                    getting raised. Instead of writing a try-catch block inside the method definition,
                                    we can write the
                                    method call also inside the try-catch block.</p>
                                <p>If the exceptions are not handled in the method definition, then it propagates to the
                                    place where you
                                    have called that method automatically. Observe the below code.</p>

                                    <li>An Exception is an unwanted event that interrupts the normal flow of the
                                        program.</li>
                                    <li>In Java, exception is basically of two types – Checked and Unchecked Exception.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Exception can be handled with try, catch and finally block.</li>
                                    <li>A single try block can have any number of catch blocks.</li>
                                    <li>A single try block must be followed by at least one catch block or finally
                                        block.</li>
                                    <li>A generic catch block can handle all the exceptions.</li>
                                    <li>If no exception occurs in try block, then the catch blocks are completely
                                        ignored.</li>
                                    <li>Generic catch block must be the last catch block of try-catch.</li>
                                    <li>Finally block is optional.</li>
                                    <li>A finally block gets executed irrespective of whether an exception occurs or
                                        not.</li>
                                    <li>A finally block must be associated with a try block, you cannot use finally
                                        without a try block.
                                    </li>

                                    <li>Exception can be raised explicitly also by using throw keyword.</li>
                                    <li>If you are propagating the exception to the method call using throw, then method
                                        must be
                                        declared with throws keyword.</li>
                                    <li>Programmer can define their own exception, i.e., create User-defined exception.

                                <p>Imagine walking into a library to get your favorite novel, but welcomed by a room
                                    full of an
                                    unorganized stack of books. Would you still go ahead and search for the novel? </p>
                                <p>Of course not!</p>
                                <p>Just as books are cataloged and arranged in a library, it is important for us to
                                    organize our Java
                                    files. In order to follow a modular approach, a set of related classes and
                                    interfaces can be grouped
                                    together at one place called package.</p>
                                <p>Packages help in organizing our Java files. It is a mechanism of grouping similar
                                    types of classes
                                    and interfaces collectively based on functionality.</p>
                                <p>Why should you create packages? What are the advantages of packages?</p>

                                <h4>Advantages</h4>
                                <p>Creating packages and grouping related documents together mainly have the following
                                    advantages:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Modularization: Real-life Java projects will have several hundreds of classes
                                        and other files.
                                        Using packages provides a good structure for projects. It becomes easier to
                                        locate the related
                                        classes which improve efficiency.</li>
                                    <li>Re-usability: It provides re-usability. If a particular functionality of class
                                        has to be
                                        accessed in a different class of different package, then, you can just import
                                        the class into
                                        different packages and use it.</li>
                                    <li>Name Conflicts: If there is a need for creating another class with the same
                                        name, then we can
                                        define two classes with the same name in different packages to avoid name
                                        collision.</li>
                                    <li>Controlled Access: It provides access protection. Protected and default have
                                        package level
                                        access control. A protected member is accessible by classes in the same package
                                        and its
                                        sub-classes of the same or another package. A default member (without any access
                                        specifier) is
                                        accessible by classes in the same package only.</li>
                                    <li>Data Encapsulation: They provide a way to hide classes, preventing other
                                        programs from accessing
                                        classes that are meant for internal use only.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Therefore, it is a good practice to use packages.</p>

                                <h5>Types of packages</h5>
                                <p>Packages can be divided into two categories:</p>
                                <ul>

                                    <li>Built-in Packages</li>
                                    <li>User-Defined Packages</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Built-in Packages: Built-in packages or predefined packages are those that come along
                                    as a part of
                                    JDK (Java Development Kit). They consist of a huge number of predefined classes and
                                    interfaces that
                                    are part of Java API. Some of the commonly used built-in packages are java.lang,
                                    java.io, java.util,
                                    etc.</p>
                                <p>User-Defined Packages: User-defined packages are those which are developed by users
                                    in order to group
                                    related classes, interfaces and sub-packages.</p>

                                <h5>Package creation</h5>
                                <p>A package in Java can be created either with the help of IDE or by using the package
                                    keyword as the
                                    first line of a Java file to specify the package of a class. There can be only one
                                    package statement
                                    in each source file and it applies to all classes or interfaces in the file.</p>
                                <p>If a package statement is not used, then the Java files will be placed in the current
                                    default
                                    package.</p>
                                <p>The naming convention for packages is to write the complete package in lowercase.</p>
                                <p>Only public classes can be imported into different packages.

                                <h4>protected</h4>
                                <p>Variables, methods and constructors which are declared protected in the parent class
                                    can be accessed
                                    only by the sub classes in other packages or any class within the same package.</p>
                                <p>The protected access modifier cannot be applied to classes and interfaces.</p>
                                <p>Protected access modifier allows the child classes present in different packages to
                                    use the protected
                                    method or variable of the parent class while preventing other classes of the
                                    different package from
                                    doing so.</p>
                                <p>Next, you would see how to access classes and files of one package in another
                                    package.</p>


                                <h4>import</h4>
                                <p>import keyword is used to import built-in or user-defined packages into a Java source
                                    file so that a
                                    class can refer to another class that is in a different package.</p>
                                <p>There are three ways to access the Java source file of one package in another
                                    package.</p>
                                <p>1)To import all the classes from a particular package:</p>
                                <p>import packagename.*;</p>
                                <p>If you use packagename.*, then all the classes and interfaces of the package will be
                                    accessible but
                                    the classes and interfaces present inside the sub packages will not be available for
                                    use.</p>
                                <p>2)To import only the class/classes you want to use:</p>
                                <p>import packagename.classname;</p>
                                <p>If you import packagename.classname, then only the class with the name classname of
                                    the package with
                                    the name packagename will be available for use.</p>
                                <p>3)Using a fully qualified name:</p>
                                <p>packagename.classname;</p>
                                <p>If you use a fully qualified name to import any class into your program, then only
                                    that particular
                                    class of the package will be accessible in your program, other classes in the same
                                    package will not
                                    be accessible. For this approach, there is no need to use the import statement but
                                    you will have to
                                    use the fully qualified name every time you are accessing the class or the
                                    interface. This is not a
                                    recommended approach.</p>

                                <h3>Recursion</h3>
                                <p>The programs that we have seen so far deal with methods that can call other methods.
                                    It is also
                                    possible for a method to call itself. This type of method is known as a recursive
                                    method. A
                                    recursive method can call itself directly or indirectly. </p>
                                <p>A method can be called recursively if it is possible to break it into smaller pieces
                                    which resemble
                                    the original method or problem. In recursion, a problem is divided into two parts
                                    –one part is known
                                    as the base condition and the other is known as the recursive condition.</p>
                                <p>In case of recursion, a complex problem is broken down into simpler versions of the
                                    problem itself.
                                    The method is called repetitively for the simpler versions of the problem and this
                                    is known as the
                                    recursive condition. This recursive call can further lead to many more recursive
                                    calls. This
                                    continues till all the calls converge to a base condition. When the base condition
                                    is executed, a
                                    value is returned. </p>
                                <p>E.g.: Files on a computer are stored in a directory. A directory can be empty,
                                    contain files or
                                    contain other directories. To list all the files in a directory, we need to first
                                    list the files
                                    inside the directory and then make recursive calls to the sub-directories present in
                                    the directory.
                                    This process continues until we reach a directory which doesn’t contain any
                                    sub-directories. </p>

                                <p>We know that n! = n*(n-1)*(n-2)* …*1 with 1! = 1 and 0! = 1. Observe that the problem
                                    n! can be
                                    divided into smaller parts: </p>

                                <p>This shows that we can solve this problem recursively. Let us understand by taking

                                <p>You can observe that the length of the program has reduced by using recursion and the

                                    simpler. This is one of the advantages of recursion. But with respect to memory,
                                    recursion is not
                                    preferred. Since, recursion makes method calls repetitively, it increases the

                                    calls.</p>

                                <p>A regular expression (or regex in short) is a sequence of characters that forms a
                                    search pattern. It
                                    is composed of various symbols and characters and is mainly used in pattern matching
                                    for searching
                                    and editing. It helps in providing a pattern against which a string can be matched.
                                </p>
                                <p>E.g. - Customer|?</p>
                                <p>Using this, let us understand the components used to form regular expressions:</p>

                                <p>There are also suitable short-hands for frequently used regular expressions. Some of
                                    them are listed

                                <p>Let us assume that the customers should set password which should have 8 to 10
                                    letters followed by 4
                                    digits. Let us validate the password.

                                    Sample passwords: rtysvsjhu1234, fgyfvdhsdb745, bdhfv1</p>
                                <p>Explanation:

                                    Since the password should begin with 8 to 10 letters, the matching pattern should
                                    start with
                                    [A-Za-z]{8,10}</p>
                                <p>The last four entries of the string should be numbers. The matching pattern should
                                    end with [0-9]{4}
                                </p>
                                <p>Thus, the overall matching pattern will be [A-Za-z]{8,10}[0-9]{4}</p>
